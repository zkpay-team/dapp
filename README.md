ZK Payments infrastructure to support use cases like private bounty and private payroll payments

- Build with [Railgun](https://railgun.org) <3
- Use case 1: An organization (like a DAO, a company, a group of freelancers) earns revenue and then needs to pay its team members.
- Use case 2: An organization got a bounty and wants to share it privately with winners while preserving their privacy and the amount sends.
- They want to split payments between many internal workers in a private way so we don't reveal how the split is done between workers and their public addresses; it preserves privacy on amounts paid and who they go to.
